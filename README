-- Genotype File Formats --
Binary PED: PLINK binary genotype file format. For more information
    see http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml
Transposed PED: PLINK transposted text genotype file format. See
    http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml
EMMA: For backwards compatibility with emma, we allow for "EMMA" file formats.
    This is just a text file with individuals on the rows and snps on the
    columns. The program looks for an associated .snp or .map file for alleles
    and SNP names, and to count the total number of SNPs.
geno: For compatability with .geno formats. This is a file with each row
    representing a SNP in {0,1,2,9} with no whitespace between individuals.
    The program looks for an associated .snp or .map file for alleles and SNP
    names, and to count the total number of SNPs.
gens: For compatability with .gens Impute2 file formats. This file has a line
    for every SNP. In each line, the first 5 words are SNPID, RSID, position,
    Allele 1 and Allele 2. After this there is a triplet of probabilities for
    each individual, representing the probabilities of genotype 0, 1 and 2.
Summary Statistics: For use with the summary statistics methods. This is a
    summary statistics file with one line for each SNP and columns
    Chr RSID position alleleFreq Beta/logOdds StandardError pValue.

-- Phenotype File Formats --
EMMA: This is just a text file with each phenotype as one row.

-- A Note about Multithreaded use a High Performance Computing --
Performance of jester is dramatically improved (up to 50x) when numpy is linked
to a machine-tuned matrix library like ATLAS or MKL. In these libraries,
multithreading is frequently supported. I have found performance gains drop
off after 4 threads for sampling mode.
